## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
emails <- read_excel('DCU COVID-19 response team (Responses)(1).xlsx') %>%
  select(EMail = 'Email address') %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(EMail)
emails$EMail
M1 <-  paste0(emails$EMail[1:100],sep=',',collapse='')
M1
M2 <-  paste0(emails$EMail[101:200],sep=',',collapse='')
M2
M3 <-  paste0(emails$EMail[201:247],sep=',',collapse='')
M3

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
